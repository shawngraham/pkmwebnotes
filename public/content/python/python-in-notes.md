# üêç Executing Python in Your Notes

You can run Python code blocks directly in your notes. This is powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), which brings a full Python environment to your browser. The status of the Python environment is shown in the header.

You write your code in the markdown note. To **execute** your code, switch to `split` or `preview` and hit the `run` button.

Use the `copy` button to copy results. I would suggest pasting these into a NEW note that you link back to your code note.

Plots can be copied or downloaded; copied plots are in your computer's clipboard and can be pasted into Word etc.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple Python code block. Click the "‚ñ∂ Run" button in the preview pane to execute it. The output will be numbered.

```python
import sys
print(f"Hello from Python {sys.version}!")

# The last expression in a cell is automatically displayed as the result
a = 10
b = 20
a + b
```

## Data Analysis with Pandas

The environment comes with \`pandas\` and \`numpy\` pre-installed. You can perform data analysis right here.

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

# Create a sample dataset
csv_data = """
fruit,quantity,color
apple,12,red
banana,18,yellow
grape,30,purple
"""

# Read it into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_data))

# Display the DataFrame
df
```

## Creating Plots

You can also generate plots using \`matplotlib\`. Any plots created will be displayed as images below the code cell.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_title("A Simple Sine Wave")
ax.set_xlabel("x")
ax.set_ylabel("sin(x)")

# The plot will be captured and displayed automatically
plt.show()
```

## Loading External Data

You can load data from URLs using the special \`#data_url:\` directive:

```python
#data_url: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/f0678127cbe4425f180b242eecaa3bb2/raw/98defb3a88db1b8e75f006c007adba6e333cb4a2/shopping.csv 
# The fetched data is available in the 'fetched_data' variable
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(fetched_data))
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} rows of data")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
df.head()
```
This uses a 'bridge' in the background that functions a bit like 'curl' in order to read data into your sandbox. Otherwise you couldn't load external data. Use gist.github.com and make your data 'secret' if you don't want it findable; then use the url behind the 'raw' button there and paste in as in the example.

## Your Results




## Important Notes

- Each note maintains its own Python environment
- Variables persist between code cells in the same note
- The execution counter [n] shows the order of execution
- First execution may take a few seconds while Pyodide loads
- Check the Python status indicator in the header (üêç)

## Available Libraries

The following libraries are pre-installed:
- pandas
- numpy  
- matplotlib
- json
- csv
- micropip (for installing additional packages)

You can install with micropip like this:

```python
await micropip.install("networkx")
```

Happy coding! üêç
