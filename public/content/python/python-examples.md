## Another Basic Example

Here's a simple Python code block. Click the "â–¶ Run" button in the preview pane to execute it. The output will be numbered.

```python
import sys
print(f"Hello from Python {sys.version}!")

# The last expression in a cell is automatically displayed as the result
a = 10
b = 20
a + b
```
