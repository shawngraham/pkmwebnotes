Here is a summary of the web application's capabilities, as deduced from the provided code:

### Core Note-Taking

*   **Markdown Support**: Notes are written in Markdown, with a live "Split" or "Preview" mode to see the rendered HTML. The app uses the `markdown-it` library, supporting standard features like headers, lists, links, bold, italics, tables, and syntax highlighting for code blocks.
*   **YAML Frontmatter**: Each note can contain a YAML metadata block at the top to define properties like `title`, `created` date, and `tags`. The application automatically parses this block to update the note's title.
*   **Automatic Saving**: Notes are saved automatically to the browser's local storage shortly after the user stops typing, providing a seamless and safe editing experience.
*   **File-Based Structure**: On first load, the application populates itself from a `manifest.json` file, creating an initial set of notes organized into folders. This suggests a portable, file-centric design philosophy.

### Advanced Linking and Knowledge Management

*   **Wiki-style Linking (Wikilinks)**: Users can create bidirectional links between notes using the `[[Note Title]]` syntax. The application intelligently handles these links:
    *   **Autocomplete**: When a user types `[[`, an autocomplete menu appears, suggesting existing notes to link to or offering to create a new one.
    *   **Stable IDs**: Behind the scenes, a user-friendly `[[Title]]` link is converted into a stable `[[note_id|Title]]` format for storage. This ensures that links don't break even if a note's title changes.
    *   **Link Renaming**: If a note's title is changed, the application prompts the user to automatically update the display text of all links pointing to it across the entire vault.
*   **Backlinks Panel**: A dedicated panel in the right sidebar automatically displays all the notes that link *to* the currently active note, showing a snippet of context for each mention.
*   **Graph Visualization**: The right sidebar features an interactive graph view that visually maps the connections between the current note and its neighbors.
    *   It uses the D3.js library to render a force-directed graph.
    *   Users can expand the view to see connections up to 3 "steps" away.
    *   Nodes in the graph are clickable, allowing for quick navigation between related ideas.
*   **Content Embedding (Transclusion)**: Notes can embed specific blocks of content from other notes using the `![[Note Title#^block-id]]` syntax, allowing for content reuse without duplication.

### Powerful User Interface

*   **Multi-Pane Layout**: The application features a robust multi-pane system where multiple notes can be opened side-by-side.
    *   Panes are resizable by dragging the dividers between them.
    *   Any pane can be maximized to fill the available width using a button or the `Ctrl/Cmd + M` shortcut.
*   **Sidebar Navigation**: A collapsible left sidebar lists all notes, organized by folder. It includes a search bar to filter notes by title or content and options to sort notes alphabetically or by modification date.
*   **Context Menus**: Right-clicking on notes, folders, or the sidebar reveals context-aware menus for actions like creating a new note, deleting a note, opening a note in a new pane, or changing the sort order.
*   **Right Sidebar**: A collapsible right sidebar provides contextual information for the active note, including word count, the link graph, and the backlinks list.

### Embedded Python Execution

*   **Live Code Execution**: Users can embed and run Python code directly within their notes using fenced code blocks (``````python````).
*   **Pyodide Integration**: The app uses Pyodide to run Python in the browser, eliminating the need for a server-side backend. This includes support for popular data science libraries.
*   **Data Fetching**: A special `#data_url:` directive at the top of a Python block allows the code to fetch data from an external URL, making it available in a `fetched_data` variable for analysis (e.g., loading a CSV into a Pandas DataFrame).
*   **Rich Output**: The output of the code, including standard text output and Matplotlib plots, is displayed directly below the code block in the preview pane. Plots can be copied as images or downloaded as files.

### Data Portability

*   **Import**: Users can import existing notes from Markdown (`.md`) or plain text (`.txt`) files.
*   **Export**: The application provides multiple export options:
    *   **JSON**: Export all notes in a single JSON file, preserving all metadata.
    *   **Markdown Files**: Export each note as an individual `.md` file.
    *   **Single Markdown File**: Combine all notes into one large Markdown document.
*   **Network Data Export**: The connection graph can be exported as a set of CSV files (`nodes`, `edges`, `statistics`, and `isolated_notes`). This data is ideal for analysis in external graph tools (like Gephi or NetworkX) and includes advanced metrics like betweenness centrality and community detection.
